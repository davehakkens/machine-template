# Building Challenges
 Describe the tools needed to build the machine and what is the most complex part of building. It's a good moment to point out the challenges that are coming with the build.
 - Drilling of the axe is hard to do precise
 - Assembling the parts takes long

# Current Status
Explain the current status of the machines, its just a drawing, you build it once, made a few of them? Is it as you like or got some feedback on it? For instance " The machine has been build, setup in our project in Hawai and run for a few months. We noted a few issues below and are still gathering more feedback."


# Identified Issues
- Axe breaks (example)
- Motor can overheat in hot settings (example)
